Twinkle is an iPad game which uses the accelerometer or gesture recognizer (depending on device capability) to move a player across the length of the screen. Star views are animated to fall 'down' the the height of the screen continuously.  The user must move the player such that she catches as many stars as are needed for each level.  This application demonstrates use of the accelerometer, swipe gestures, core animation, NSTimer class, and the programatic construction of views and buttons.
